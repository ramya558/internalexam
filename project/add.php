     <h2>Donald Trump likely to remove National Security Adviser HR McMaster</h2>
     <p> President Donald Trump has decided to replace his national security adviser, HR McMaster, but the move is not expected to be made immediately, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.
Citing five people with knowledge of the plans, the Post said Trump was considering several possible replacements, including former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and Keith Kellogg,
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Tuesday, Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president has signaled in recent days that a shake-up at the top levels of his administration was not over.
"I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want," Trump told reporters after Tillerson was fired.

   <h2>Prakash Raj: Acquittal of Sri Ram Sene members a matter of shame</h2>
   <p>Actor Prakash Raj, known for his straight talk, expressed his frustration at the acquittal Sri Ram Sene chief Pramod Muthalik and other members of his right wing group. Sri Ram Sene attacked a pub in Mangaluru in 2009 in the name of 'protecting Indian culture'. Sri Ram Sene members had even attacked female patrons inside the club.
While talking to India Today, Prakash Raj said that the acquittals are something we should be ashamed of.
He questions the logic behind the acquittal.
'Which law states that even if you have evidence, the accused can be acquitted just because the victim didn't file a complaint and there were no witnesses?' asked Prakash Raj
The actor stated that there was enough evidence an that people who came ahead to provide it were probably threatened.</p>
